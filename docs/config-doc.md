# pagefault — Configuration Reference

pagefault is a runtime for a single YAML configuration file. Everything
(backends, contexts, auth, filters, tools, audit) lives in this file.

The loader expands `${ENV_VAR}` references in the file contents before
parsing, so secrets can be externalized.

## Top-level shape

```yaml
server:   { ... }   # HTTP listener
auth:     { ... }   # authentication layer
backends: [ ... ]   # data sources (required, at least one)
contexts: [ ... ]   # pre-composed bundles (optional)
tools:    { ... }   # per-tool enable/disable (optional)
filters:  { ... }   # optional filter pipeline
audit:    { ... }   # audit logging
```

A minimal working config is in `configs/minimal.yaml` (filesystem
backend only). For a tour of every backend type with inline docs, see
`configs/example.yaml`.

## `server`

```yaml
server:
  host: "127.0.0.1"     # required
  port: 8444            # required (1..65535)
  public_url: "https://pagefault.example.com"  # optional — advertised by /api/openapi.json and prepended to SSE endpoint events
  cors:
    enabled: false
    allowed_origins: ["https://chat.openai.com"]
    allowed_methods: ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"]
    allowed_headers: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"]
    allow_credentials: false
    max_age: 600
  rate_limit:
    enabled: false
    rps: 10              # steady-state tokens per second per caller
    burst: 20            # bucket size per caller
  mcp:
    sse_enabled: true    # default — mount /sse + /message for Claude Desktop and other SSE clients
    instructions: ""     # optional override — replaces the built-in default text
```

| Field        | Type   | Default       | Notes |
|--------------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `host`       | string | `127.0.0.1`   | Bind address. |
| `port`       | int    | `8444`        | Listen port. |
| `public_url` | string | empty         | Advertised as the `servers[0].url` in `/api/openapi.json`. Also used as the `baseURL` passed to mcp-go's SSE server: when set, the SSE `endpoint` event emits an absolute URL (safer behind reverse proxies); when empty, it emits a root-relative path which the client resolves against the URL it was pointed at. |

### `server.cors`

Opt-in cross-origin handling for the REST transport. When `enabled: false`
(default) no CORS headers are emitted and browsers reject cross-origin
requests — fine for loopback and same-origin deployments. Setting
`enabled: true` with an empty `allowed_origins` list is equivalent to
`enabled: false`.

| Field                    | Type     | Default                         | Notes |
|--------------------------|----------|---------------------------------|-------|
| `enabled`                | bool     | `false`                         | Master switch. |
| `allowed_origins`        | string[] | `[]`                            | Exact-match origin allowlist. Use `"*"` for any origin (downgraded to echo-mode when `allow_credentials: true`). |
| `allowed_methods`        | string[] | `[GET, POST, OPTIONS]`          | Preflight `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`. |
| `allowed_headers`        | string[] | `[Content-Type, Authorization]` | Preflight `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`. |
| `allow_credentials`      | bool     | `false`                         | Emits `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. |
| `max_age`                | int      | `600`                           | Preflight cache in seconds. |

### `server.rate_limit`

Per-caller token bucket applied after auth. Callers are keyed on their
resolved `caller.id` (token id for bearer auth, header value for
trusted-header auth, or literal `"anonymous"` for `mode: none`). When
`enabled: false` the middleware is a no-op.

| Field      | Type    | Default | Notes |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|
| `enabled`  | bool    | `false` | Master switch. |
| `rps`      | float   | `10`    | Steady-state refill rate (tokens/second). |
| `burst`    | int     | `20`    | Bucket size — maximum burst before throttling kicks in. |

A caller that exceeds its budget receives HTTP 429 with a
`Retry-After` header and the standard structured error envelope:

```json
{"error": {"code": "rate_limited", "status": 429, "message": "rate limit exceeded"}}
```

### `server.mcp`

Controls the MCP transports and the initialize-time metadata advertised
to connecting clients. Both the streamable-http transport (`/mcp`) and
the legacy-SSE transport (`/sse` + `/message`) share the same underlying
MCPServer, so tool registrations, auth, and rate limiting are identical
across the two — this block just gates the SSE pair and lets operators
replace the built-in instructions text.

| Field                              | Type   | Default  | Notes |
|------------------------------------|--------|----------|-------|
| `sse_enabled`                      | bool   | `true`   | Mounts `GET /sse` and `POST /message`. Keep the default on so Claude Desktop and other SSE-only clients work out of the box; set `false` if you only serve streamable-http clients and want to minimise the public surface. |
| `instructions`                     | string | built-in | Overrides the server-level instructions string advertised in the MCP `initialize` response. Most MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.) surface this text in the agent's system prompt, which makes it the single most reliable lever for teaching agents *when* to reach for `pf_*` tools vs the built-ins. Empty means "use the built-in default from `internal/tool/instructions.go`", which is the recommended starting point — only override when you want to add installation-specific guidance (e.g. "daily notes live under `memory://daily/`, project docs under `memory://projects/`"). |
| `sse_keepalive`                    | bool   | `true`   | Emits JSON-RPC `ping` events on the persistent `GET /sse` stream to keep intermediate proxies from closing an idle connection during a long `pf_fault` call. Defaults to **on** because the failure mode without it (tool calls dying after "几十秒" regardless of `timeout_seconds`) is hard to diagnose. Set `false` only when you have verified your proxy chain never closes idle SSE streams or you have a client that rejects unsolicited `ping` requests. |
| `sse_keepalive_interval_seconds`   | int    | `15`     | Ticker interval (in seconds) for the SSE keepalive pings. Pagefault's default of 15 is longer than mcp-go's own 10-second default but still comfortably under the common 30 / 60 second proxy idle timeouts. Set lower for aggressive proxies (e.g. nginx with `proxy_read_timeout 10s`); values at or below zero are clamped to the default. Ignored when `sse_keepalive: false`. |

> **Why keepalives?** A `pf_fault` call blocks inside
> `SubagentBackend.Spawn` for as long as the subagent takes to
> respond — often 30-120s. On the persistent `GET /sse` stream,

> few-byte JSON-RPC notification every `sse_keepalive_interval_seconds`,
> which counts as "activity" from every proxy's perspective
> and keeps the connection alive for the real response.

**Why not just rely on tool descriptions?** Tool descriptions tell an
agent *how* to call a tool once it has decided to; instructions tell
the agent *when* a whole server is relevant in the first place. Both
matter — pagefault ships reasonable defaults for each — but the
instructions string is the one to edit when you want to nudge agent
behaviour without touching source.

**Transport selection cheat-sheet:**

| Client                    | Transport         | Endpoint to point at                       |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Claude Code               | streamable-http   | `https://<host>/mcp`                       |
| Claude Desktop            | SSE               | `https://<host>/sse`                       |
| ChatGPT Custom GPT        | REST (OpenAPI)    | `https://<host>/api/openapi.json`          |
| curl / raw HTTP client    | REST              | `POST https://<host>/api/pf_<tool>`        |

#### Instructions override: worked example

`instructions` is a full **replace**, not a layer — a non-empty value
displaces the built-in default verbatim. That means an operator who
just wants to add one installation-specific sentence has two options:

1. **Short custom replacement** — write a terse instructions block
   that covers only your setup. Good when you run a tightly scoped
   pagefault instance (single backend, single agent) and don't need
   the full cross-language signal-phrase catalogue. Trade-off: you
   lose the built-in multi-agent routing, timeout-floor, and
   "don't claim no memory" guidance, so you have to re-add anything
   you still want.

2. **Copy-and-extend** — paste the default from
   `internal/tool/instructions.go` into a YAML block scalar and add
   your additions. More text to maintain, but preserves every
   guardrail the default ships with.

The most common real-world override adds **"where does MY chat
history and memory live"** context on top of the default, because
that's the single highest-leverage thing an agent in a multi-MCP
session needs to know. A worked example:

```yaml
server:
  mcp:
    instructions: |
      pagefault is the user's personal memory server on this
      deployment. The pf_* tools read and write the user's:

      - Daily notes under memory://daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
      - Project docs under memory://projects/<slug>/
      - A lossless-compressed archive of every past chat session
        with wocha (work) and cha (personal) — queryable via
        pf_fault with agent="wocha" or agent="cha" respectively.

      ## Core rule

      If the user asks about their own past activity, past
      decisions, or a past conversation, you MUST call a pf_*
      tool before answering. Do not say "I don't remember" /
      "我不记得" — your context is only this session, but the
      archive covers everything else.

      ## Routing

      1. Concrete keyword / date / filename → pf_scan.
      2. Natural-language question ("what did I do in March",
         "我三月在干嘛") → pf_ps first to see wocha and cha,
         then pf_fault with the right agent. For queries that
         straddle work and personal, fan out to both and merge.
      3. "Remember this" / "记一下" → pf_poke mode:agent,
         routed through cha for personal notes or wocha for
         work notes.

      pf_fault.timeout_seconds must be >= 120 — real runs take
      20-40s before the first token and can exceed a minute.

      Do NOT call these tools for general world knowledge,
      current-repo code questions, or anything answerable from
      this session's context alone.
```

Two things this example does that the default cannot:

- **Names the specific backends** (`wocha`, `cha`,
  `memory://daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`). The default is backend-agnostic
  because it doesn't know what an operator wired up; a real
  operator *does* know, and spelling it out routes queries faster.
- **Prescribes concrete agent selection by name.** Rather than the
  abstract "pick by description" guidance in the default, the
  override says "wocha for work, cha for personal" directly. For a
  multi-MCP session where attention is scarce, this kind of
  concrete routing hint is the most reliable signal an agent can
  get.

If you don't want to maintain a full override but still want one
concrete installation-specific note, the minimum viable version is
a short block that **mentions your highest-value backend by name**
so Claude knows it exists — e.g. "past chat history with wocha is
searchable via pf_fault agent=wocha" as a single paragraph. Even
that one line is enough to lift the zh-CN "我最近跟你聊了什么"
case out of the "I don't remember" trap.

## `auth`

```yaml
auth:
  mode: "bearer"                        # "none" | "bearer" | "trusted_header" | "oauth2"
  bearer:
    tokens_file: "/etc/pagefault/tokens.jsonl"
  trusted_header:
    header: "X-Forwarded-User"
    trusted_proxies: ["127.0.0.1"]
  oauth2:
    clients_file: "/etc/pagefault/oauth-clients.jsonl"
    # issuer: "https://pagefault.example.com"  # optional override
    # access_token_ttl_seconds: 3600
    # default_scopes: ["mcp"]
    # auth_code_ttl_seconds: 60               # authorization code lifetime (default 60)
    # auto_approve: true                       # skip consent page (default true)
```

| Field                           | Type     | Required when          | Notes |
|---------------------------------|----------|------------------------|-------|
| `mode`                          | enum     | always                 | `none`, `bearer`, `trusted_header`, or `oauth2`. |
| `bearer.tokens_file`            | path     | `mode: bearer` or compound `oauth2` | JSONL file, one record per line. |
| `trusted_header.header`         | string   | `mode: trusted_header` | Header name carrying the identity. |
| `trusted_header.trusted_proxies` | string[] | optional              | If set, the remote IP must be in this list. |
| `oauth2.clients_file`           | path     | `mode: oauth2`         | JSONL of registered OAuth2 clients. Managed via `pagefault oauth-client create / ls / revoke`. |
| `oauth2.issuer`                 | URL      | optional               | Override for the `iss` / `authorization_servers` value in the RFC 9728 + RFC 8414 discovery documents. Empty falls back to `server.public_url`, then to the incoming request's scheme + host (honouring `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host` when present). |
| `oauth2.access_token_ttl_seconds` | int    | optional               | Access token lifetime in seconds. Default `3600` (1 hour). Claude Desktop re-exchanges its credentials automatically when its cached token expires, so a short TTL is safe and limits the blast radius of a leaked token. |
| `oauth2.default_scopes`         | string[] | optional               | Scope list attached to newly issued tokens when the caller requests none. Default `["mcp"]` matches the MCP client ecosystem convention. |
| `oauth2.auth_code_ttl_seconds`  | int      | optional               | Authorization code lifetime in seconds. Default `60`. Short TTL limits the window for code interception; 60s is generous enough for a browser redirect round-trip. |
| `oauth2.auto_approve`           | bool     | optional               | When `true` (default), `GET /oauth/authorize` immediately redirects with the authorization code — no consent page is shown. Set `false` to render an HTML consent page before issuing the code. Single-operator servers should leave this at the default; the operator is authorizing themselves. |

### Token file format (`bearer`)

One JSON object per line, blank lines and `#`-prefixed comment lines allowed:

```jsonl
# My tokens
{"id":"laptop","token":"pf_xxx","label":"Laptop","metadata":{"device":"macos"}}
{"id":"phone","token":"pf_yyy","label":"Phone"}
```

Tokens are managed with `pagefault token create / ls / revoke`.

### `mode: oauth2` — client_credentials + authorization code (shipped in 0.7.0, auth code + PKCE in 0.8.0)

`mode: "oauth2"` runs two RFC 6749 grant types against an
operator-managed client registry:

1. **client_credentials** (0.7.0) — for programmatic clients that
   exchange a static client_id + client_secret for a token.
2. **authorization_code + PKCE** (0.8.0) — for interactive clients
   like Claude Desktop that use the MCP-standard browser-based
   OAuth 2.1 flow. PKCE (S256 only) protects the flow; public
   clients (no client_secret) authenticate via PKCE alone.

When oauth2 mode is active, five public endpoints are mounted on the
server **outside** the auth middleware (they have to be reachable
before a token exists):

| Endpoint | Spec | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` | [RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728) | Points MCP clients at the authorization server for this resource. |
| `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` | [RFC 8414](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) | Advertises the authorization endpoint, token endpoint, supported grants (`client_credentials`, `authorization_code`), response types (`code`), code challenge methods (`S256`), and supported auth methods. |
| `GET /oauth/authorize` | [RFC 6749 §4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) | Authorization endpoint for the auth code flow. Validates client_id, redirect_uri, PKCE code_challenge, and state. Auto-approves by default (redirects immediately with code). |
| `POST /oauth/authorize` | [RFC 6749 §4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) | Consent form submission (when `auto_approve: false`). |
| `POST /oauth/token` | [RFC 6749](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) | Exchanges client credentials (client_credentials) or authorization code (authorization_code + PKCE) for an access token. |

The discovery endpoints are always public; the token endpoint is
public but authenticates via client credentials rather than bearer
tokens. The MCP and `/api/*` routes continue to require
`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` and are unchanged.

#### Clients file format

One JSON object per line, with a **bcrypt** secret hash (confidential
clients) or no secret at all (public clients). The plaintext secret
is printed exactly once by `pagefault oauth-client create` and is
not stored anywhere else:

```jsonl
# Confidential client (client_credentials or authorization_code with secret)
{"id":"claude-desktop","label":"Claude Desktop","secret_hash":"$2a$10$...","scopes":["mcp"],"redirect_uris":["http://localhost:3000/callback"],"metadata":{"created_at":"2026-04-11T00:00:00Z"}}
# Public client (authorization_code + PKCE only, no secret)
{"id":"claude-desktop-public","label":"Claude Desktop (PKCE)","secret_hash":"","scopes":["mcp"],"redirect_uris":["http://localhost:3000/callback"],"metadata":{"created_at":"2026-04-11T00:00:00Z"}}
```

The CLI workflow mirrors `pagefault token`:

```bash
# Confidential client (has a secret, can use client_credentials)
pagefault oauth-client create --label "Claude Desktop" --config ./pagefault.yaml

# Public client (no secret, PKCE-only authorization code flow)
pagefault oauth-client create --label "Claude Desktop" --public \
  --redirect-uris "http://localhost:3000/callback" --config ./pagefault.yaml

# With explicit redirect URIs (required for authorization_code flow)
pagefault oauth-client create --label "Claude Desktop" \
  --redirect-uris "http://localhost:3000/callback,http://localhost:4000/callback" \
  --config ./pagefault.yaml

pagefault oauth-client ls                                --config ./pagefault.yaml
pagefault oauth-client revoke claude-desktop             --config ./pagefault.yaml
```

Scopes can be narrowed per-client via `--scopes "mcp mcp.read"`; the
default is `["mcp"]`. Revoking a client removes future token
issuance but does NOT invalidate access tokens that have already
been issued — those remain valid until their TTL expires or the
server restarts. Restart pagefault if you need immediate
invalidation.

#### Compound mode (`oauth2` + legacy `bearer`)

Set `auth.mode: oauth2` **and** populate `auth.bearer.tokens_file` at
the same time. The OAuth2 provider validates issued access tokens
first, and falls back to the bearer token store on no match. This
lets operators move Claude Desktop to OAuth2 one client at a time
while Claude Code (or any other client already using a long-lived
bearer token) keeps working unchanged. Audit log entries look the
same either way — the caller id + label come from whichever store
matched.

#### Worked example: Claude Desktop via authorization code + PKCE

Claude Desktop uses the MCP-standard OAuth 2.1 flow with PKCE. The
recommended setup is a **public client** (no client_secret):

```yaml
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8444
  public_url: "https://pagefault.example.com"
  mcp:
    sse_enabled: true
    # Keepalive pings protect long pf_fault calls against idle
    # proxy timeouts on the native /sse stream.
    sse_keepalive: true

auth:
  mode: "oauth2"
  oauth2:
    clients_file: "/etc/pagefault/oauth-clients.jsonl"
    access_token_ttl_seconds: 3600
    default_scopes: ["mcp"]
    auth_code_ttl_seconds: 60    # auth code lifetime (default 60)
    auto_approve: true           # skip consent page (default true)
  bearer:
    # Claude Code keeps using its static bearer token via this
    # fallback path; only Claude Desktop needs the OAuth2 flow.
    tokens_file: "/etc/pagefault/tokens.jsonl"
```

```bash
# 1. Register Claude Desktop as a public OAuth2 client.
pagefault oauth-client create --label "Claude Desktop" \
  --public \
  --redirect-uris "http://localhost:3000/callback" \
  --config /etc/pagefault/pagefault.yaml
#   id:     claude-desktop
#   label:  Claude Desktop
#   scopes: mcp
#   redirect_uris: http://localhost:3000/callback
#   type:   public (PKCE-only, no client_secret)

# 2. Start pagefault.
pagefault serve --config /etc/pagefault/pagefault.yaml
```

Then in Claude Desktop's MCP SSE configuration, set the server URL
to `https://pagefault.example.com/sse` and paste `claude-desktop`
into the Client ID field. Leave the Client Secret field empty.
When you click connect, Claude Desktop will discover the
authorization endpoint, open a browser tab (auto-approved by
default), and exchange the authorization code for a token using
PKCE — no client_secret needed.

If you prefer the older client_credentials flow instead, register
a confidential client (omit `--public`) and paste both the Client
ID and the printed `pf_cs_...` secret into Claude Desktop's
configuration.

#### Issuer resolution and reverse proxies

The discovery endpoints advertise an `issuer` URL. Preference:

1. `auth.oauth2.issuer` explicit override
2. `server.public_url`
3. Inferred from the incoming request's scheme + host (checking
   `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers)

Behind a reverse proxy that rewrites the Host header without
setting the corresponding `X-Forwarded-*` headers, paths (2) and
(3) can misreport. Set `auth.oauth2.issuer` explicitly (or at least
`server.public_url`) for any deployment that clients will reach via
a proxy.

## `backends`

At least one backend is required. Each entry has a unique `name` and a
`type`. Phase 1 ships `filesystem`; Phase 2 adds `subprocess`, `http`,
`subagent-cli`, and `subagent-http`. See each type-specific section
below for its required fields.

```yaml
backends:
  - name: fs
    type: filesystem
    root: "/home/jet/.openclaw/workspace"
    include: ["memory/**/*.md", "AGENTS.md"]
    exclude: ["memory/intimate.md"]
    uri_scheme: "memory"
    auto_tag:
      "memory/**/*.md": ["daily", "memory"]
      "AGENTS.md":      ["config", "bootstrap"]
    sandbox: true
```

### `filesystem` backend

| Field            | Type                | Required | Default  | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|-------|
| `name`           | string              | yes      | —        | Unique backend identifier. |
| `type`           | string              | yes      | —        | Must be `filesystem`. |
| `root`           | path                | yes      | —        | Directory to serve. Resolved to an absolute path at startup. |
| `include`        | string[]            | no       | all      | Doublestar globs; files must match at least one to be visible. |
| `exclude`        | string[]            | no       | —        | Globs; files matching any are hidden. |
| `uri_scheme`     | string              | yes      | —        | URI scheme for this backend (e.g. `memory`). |
| `auto_tag`       | map[string][]string | no       | —        | Path glob → tag list. Tags become resource metadata and are visible to the tag filter. |
| `sandbox`        | bool                | no       | `false`  | If true, reject any file whose resolved path (after symlink resolution) escapes `root`. |
| `writable`       | bool                | no       | `false`  | Phase 4. Set to `true` to enable `pf_poke` against this backend. Every other write field below is ignored when this is false. |
| `write_paths`    | string[]            | no       | `[]`     | Phase 4. Doublestar URI globs that accept writes. **Patterns must include the URI scheme** (e.g. `memory://memory/*.md`), unlike `include` which matches against relative paths — a scheme-less `notes/*.md` here silently matches nothing. Empty means "every URI that passes `include`", which is rarely what you want. |
| `write_mode`     | string              | no       | `append` | Phase 4. `append` (default, safest) or `any`. Currently the only observable effect of `any` is unlocking `format: "raw"` on `pf_poke`; prepend and overwrite operations are reserved but not yet implemented. Validated at config load. |
| `max_entry_size` | int                 | no       | `2000`   | Phase 4. Max bytes per `pf_poke` payload, measured on the **raw caller-supplied content** before entry-template wrapping (so `format: "entry"` and `format: "raw"` share one budget). Enforced by the tool layer, not the backend — see 0.5.1 fix notes. Zero is unused as a sentinel: `applyWriteDefaults` rewrites it to the 2000-byte safe default when `writable: true`, so an explicit `max_entry_size: 0` does not mean "unlimited". Set a very large number if you truly want no effective cap. |
| `file_locking`   | string              | no       | `flock`  | Phase 4. `flock` takes a POSIX advisory lock (LOCK_EX) around each write, cooperating with other flock-aware writers on the same machine. `none` skips locking and relies on pagefault's per-writer mutex only — single-writer deployments only. |

**Writable backends are read-only by default.** `writable: false` is the
zero value and the safe default. A read-only filesystem backend exposes
exactly the Phase-1 surface (`pf_peek`, `pf_scan`, `pf_load`) and nothing
else — `pf_poke` attempts against it terminate with
`403 access_violation`.

**Sandbox and writes.** When `sandbox: true` is also set (which you
want), the write path resolver walks up the parent chain of the target
URI to find the first existing component, resolves its symlinks, and
refuses the write if the resolved path escapes `root`. This protects
against a `root/notes → /etc` symlink being used to write
`memory://notes/leak.md` into `/etc/leak.md`.

**Example — a typical personal memory write config:**

```yaml
- name: fs
  type: filesystem
  root: "/home/jet/.openclaw/workspace"
  include: ["memory/**/*.md", "MEMORY.md"]
  uri_scheme: "memory"
  sandbox: true
  writable: true
  write_paths:
    - "memory://memory/20*.md"    # daily notes
    - "memory://memory/todos.md"  # todo list
    - "memory://MEMORY.md"        # long-term memory
  write_mode: "append"
  max_entry_size: 2000
  file_locking: "flock"
```

### `subprocess` backend

Runs an external command to answer `Search` requests. Canonical use:
ripgrep. `Read` is not supported — point a filesystem backend at the
same roots if you need content too.

```yaml
- name: rg
  type: subprocess
  command: "rg --json -i -n --max-count 20 {query} {roots}"
  roots:
    - "/home/jet/.openclaw/workspace/memory"
    - "/home/jet/.openclaw/self-improving"
  timeout: 10
  parse: "ripgrep_json"
```

| Field     | Type     | Required | Default    | Notes |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| `name`    | string   | yes      | —          | Backend name. |
| `type`    | string   | yes      | —          | Must be `subprocess`. |
| `command` | string   | yes      | —          | Tokenized command template. Each token is a separate argv element — **no shell interpretation**, so `{query}` cannot break out of its slot. Placeholders: `{query}`, `{roots}`. A bare `{roots}` token is spliced in as multiple argv elements. |
| `roots`   | string[] | no       | —          | Directories passed into `{roots}`. |
| `timeout` | int      | no       | `10`       | Seconds before the command is killed. |
| `parse`   | string   | no       | `plain`    | Stdout parser: `ripgrep_json` (ripgrep `--json`), `grep` (`path:lineno:content`), or `plain` (one snippet per line, no URI). |

The backend treats `exit 1` as "no matches" (matches grep/ripgrep
conventions) and returns an empty result. Any other non-zero exit, or a
timeout, surfaces as `ErrBackendUnavailable` (HTTP 502).

### `http` backend

Generic HTTP search backend. Issues a single HTTP request per
`Search` call, extracts a result array from the JSON response, and
converts each entry into a `SearchResult`.

```yaml
- name: lcm
  type: http
  base_url: "http://127.0.0.1:6443"
  auth:
    mode: "bearer"
    token: "${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN}"
  search:
    method: "POST"
    path: "/api/lcm/search"
    body_template: '{"query": "{query}", "limit": {limit}}'
    response_path: "results"
  timeout: 15
```

| Field                    | Type   | Required | Default | Notes |
|--------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| `name`                   | string | yes      | —       | Backend name. |
| `type`                   | string | yes      | —       | Must be `http`. |
| `base_url`               | string | yes      | —       | Root URL. Trailing slash is stripped. |
| `auth.mode`              | string | no       | none    | `bearer` to send an `Authorization: Bearer …` header. |
| `auth.token`             | string | required for bearer | —  | Bearer token. `${ENV}` substitution happens at config-load time. |
| `search.method`          | string | no       | `POST`  | HTTP method. |
| `search.path`            | string | yes      | —       | Appended to `base_url`. |
| `search.headers`         | map    | no       | —       | Extra request headers. |
| `search.body_template`   | string | no       | —       | Request body with `{query}` and `{limit}` placeholders. `{query}` is JSON-escaped. If empty, no body is sent. |
| `search.response_path`   | string | no       | —       | Dotted path to the array in the response JSON (e.g. `results` or `data.items`). `$.`-prefix is tolerated. Empty means "response is the array itself". |
| `timeout`                | int    | no       | `15`    | Seconds before the request is cancelled. |

Each array element in the response is coerced into a `SearchResult`.
Recognised keys (all optional): `uri`, `snippet`, `score`, `metadata`.
Unknown keys are ignored.

`Read` is not supported on generic HTTP backends.

### `subagent-cli` backend

Spawns an external agent process for `pf_fault` and `pf_poke`
mode:agent. The subagent is responsible for doing its own retrieval;
pagefault just runs the command and waits for stdout.

```yaml
- name: openclaw
  type: subagent-cli
  command: "openclaw agent run --agent {agent_id} --task {task} --timeout {timeout}"
  timeout: 300
  # Optional server-side prompt wrappers. See "Subagent prompt
  # templates" below for the full mechanism.
  # retrieve_prompt_template: |
  #   You are wocha's memory retriever. ...
  # write_prompt_template: |
  #   You are wocha's memory writer. ...
  agents:
    - id: wocha
      description: "Dev agent with Feishu, LCM, workspace, and coding tools"
    - id: main
      description: "Primary personal agent with full tool access"
      # Per-agent overrides (optional) — win over the backend
      # defaults above.
      # retrieve_prompt_template: "..."
      # write_prompt_template: "..."
```

| Field        | Type     | Required | Default | Notes |
|--------------|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| `name`       | string   | yes      | —       | Backend name. |
| `type`       | string   | yes      | —       | Must be `subagent-cli`. |
| `command`    | string   | yes      | —       | Tokenized command template. Placeholders: `{agent_id}`, `{task}`, `{timeout}`. Same non-shell tokenization as `subprocess`. `{task}` is substituted with the *prompt-wrapped* task, not the raw caller input — see the prompt template section below. |
| `timeout`    | int      | no       | `300`   | Default seconds before the child is killed. Overridden per call by `pf_fault.timeout_seconds`. |
| `retrieve_prompt_template` | string | no | built-in default | Backend-wide prompt template for `pf_fault` calls. See the "Subagent prompt templates" subsection below for placeholders and rationale. Empty uses `internal/backend.DefaultRetrievePromptTemplate`. |
| `write_prompt_template`    | string | no | built-in default | Backend-wide prompt template for `pf_poke` mode:agent calls. Empty uses `internal/backend.DefaultWritePromptTemplate`. |
| `agents`     | [object] | yes      | —       | At least one. Each has `id` (required), `description`, and optional per-agent `retrieve_prompt_template` / `write_prompt_template` overrides that win over the backend-level fields above. If `pf_fault.agent` / `pf_poke.agent` is empty at call time, the first entry is used as a fallback — but calling agents are told (via the default MCP instructions) to call `pf_ps` first in multi-agent setups and pick by description, so **make each `description` specific enough to route on**. Vague descriptions like "the default agent" silently cause wrong-scope calls. |

On deadline, the process is killed; any stdout captured so far is
returned as `partial_result` with `timed_out: true`.

### `subagent-http` backend

Same role as `subagent-cli` but spawns the agent via HTTP. Useful when
agents live behind a gateway.

```yaml
- name: openclaw-http
  type: subagent-http
  base_url: "https://localhost:6443/api"
  auth:
    mode: "bearer"
    token: "${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN}"
  spawn:
    method: "POST"
    path: "/agents/{agent_id}/run"
    body_template: '{"task": "{task}", "timeout": {timeout}}'
    response_path: "result"
  timeout: 300
  agents:
    - id: wocha
      description: "Dev agent with Feishu, LCM, workspace, and coding tools"
```

| Field                  | Type     | Required | Default | Notes |
|------------------------|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| `name`                 | string   | yes      | —       | Backend name. |
| `type`                 | string   | yes      | —       | Must be `subagent-http`. |
| `base_url`             | string   | yes      | —       | Root URL. |
| `auth.mode`            | string   | no       | none    | `bearer` supported. |
| `auth.token`           | string   | required for bearer | — | Bearer token (supports `${ENV}`). |
| `spawn.method`         | string   | no       | `POST`  | HTTP method. |
| `spawn.path`           | string   | yes      | —       | Appended to `base_url`. `{agent_id}` in the path is substituted. |
| `spawn.headers`        | map      | no       | —       | Extra request headers. |
| `spawn.body_template`  | string   | no       | —       | Body template with `{agent_id}`, `{task}`, `{timeout}`. `{task}` is substituted with the prompt-wrapped task (see below) *and then* JSON-escaped, so newlines and quotes in the default templates survive unchanged. |
| `spawn.response_path`  | string   | no       | —       | Dotted path to the agent's response string. Non-string leaves are re-encoded as JSON. Empty means "the whole response body is the answer". |
| `timeout`              | int      | no       | `300`   | Default seconds. Overridden per call. |
| `retrieve_prompt_template` | string | no | built-in default | Same semantics as on the CLI backend — see "Subagent prompt templates" below. |
| `write_prompt_template`    | string | no | built-in default | Same. |
| `agents`               | [object] | yes      | —       | At least one. Each has `id`, `description`, and optional per-agent `retrieve_prompt_template` / `write_prompt_template` overrides. Same "make descriptions specific enough to route on" rule as the CLI backend above — the caller is told to call `pf_ps` first and pick by description in multi-agent setups. |

### Subagent prompt templates

A fresh subagent has no idea it is supposed to be a *memory*
agent. Left alone, it will answer the raw query from its own
training data — the real failure mode that showed up in deployment
review where a pf_fault for "what did I note about oleander" came
back as a general toxicity sheet instead of a chat-history recall.
The fix is a server-side wrap applied inside `Spawn`: the raw
caller content (the user's query for `pf_fault`, the content to
persist for `pf_poke` mode:agent) is substituted into a prompt
template that frames the agent's job explicitly, and only then
passed through the backend's `command` / `body_template`.

**Precedence (highest wins):**

1. Per-agent override — `agents[i].retrieve_prompt_template`
   / `agents[i].write_prompt_template`
2. Per-backend default — `retrieve_prompt_template` /
   `write_prompt_template` at the top of the backend entry
3. Built-in default — `DefaultRetrievePromptTemplate` /
   `DefaultWritePromptTemplate` in `internal/backend/prompt.go`

**Placeholders inside a template:**

| Placeholder     | Substituted with                                          | Available on |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `{task}`        | The raw caller content (query or write body)              | both         |
| `{time_range}`  | Formatted time range line, or empty (see `pf_fault.time_range_start`/`time_range_end`) | retrieve     |
| `{target}`      | Free-form placement hint from `pf_poke.target`            | write        |
| `{agent_id}`    | Resolved agent id (after default fallback)                | both         |

Unknown placeholders pass through unchanged, so typos in a
custom template are visible to the subagent rather than silently
dropping content.

**The built-in defaults** live in
`internal/backend/prompt.go` as exported constants. Key framing
the retrieval default enforces:

- "You are a memory-retrieval agent" (not generic Q&A)
- "Your job is to SEARCH … not to generate new content, and not
  to answer from your own training data or world knowledge"
- An enumeration of memory sources to try (MEMORY.md, managed
  memory directories like workspace/memory, embedded search
  mechanisms like qmd, structured databases like lossless-lcm,
  any other memory service in the environment)
- "If you cannot find anything relevant, say so plainly and
  stop — do not invent content to look helpful"

The write default mirrors this as a *placement* agent:

- "You are a memory-write agent … persist the content below
  into the user's memory at the most appropriate location"
- Instructions to inspect the existing layout, follow naming
  conventions, prefer extending existing files over creating
  new ones
- Reports the file path(s) and a one-line summary when done

**When to override.** Keep the built-in defaults unless (a) you
run multiple agents with meaningfully different scopes — one
strict daily-journal-only agent plus one freer long-term-notes
agent, say — where a per-agent override is clearer than the
`target` hint; or (b) your memory layout has installation-
specific sources the default enumeration does not mention (e.g.
"my notes live in a custom Obsidian vault at ~/brain"). In that
case, fork the default template and extend the "use every
memory source" bullet list. Do not strip the "do not fall back
to world knowledge" framing — that is the whole point.

---

## `contexts`

Pre-composed bundles of backend resources that clients can request by name.

```yaml
contexts:
  - name: user-profile
    description: "User profile and preferences"
    sources:
      - backend: fs
        uri: "memory://USER.md"
      - backend: fs
        uri: "memory://IDENTITY.md"
    format: "markdown"
    max_size: 8000
```

| Field          | Type     | Required | Default    | Notes |
|----------------|----------|----------|------------|-------|
| `name`         | string   | yes      | —          | Region name (unique). |
| `description`  | string   | no       | —          | Shown by `pf_maps`. |
| `sources`      | [object] | yes      | —          | At least one source required. |
| `sources[].backend` | string | yes    | —          | Backend name from the `backends` section. |
| `sources[].uri`     | string | yes    | —          | URI to load. |
| `sources[].params`  | object | no     | —          | Reserved for future dynamic-source features; currently accepted but ignored. |
| `format`       | string   | no       | `markdown` | Output format: `markdown`, `markdown-with-metadata`, or `json`. Clients can override per request via `pf_load.format`. |
| `max_size`     | int      | no       | `16000`    | Max characters before truncation. Truncation is UTF-8-safe (rune-aligned). |

When a source cannot be read (missing file, filter block), the source is
dropped from the concatenated output but recorded in the `pf_load` response
under `skipped_sources` (with a reason) and logged at `WARN` level. The
request as a whole is not aborted.

---

## `tools`

Enable or disable individual tools. All tools default to enabled.

```yaml
tools:
  pf_maps:  true    # list_contexts: memory regions / contexts
  pf_load:  true    # get_context: load a region
  pf_scan:  true    # search across backends
  pf_peek:  true    # read a resource by URI
  pf_fault: true    # deep_retrieve — Phase 2, requires a SubagentBackend
  pf_ps:    true    # list_agents  — Phase 2, lists configured subagents
  pf_poke:  true    # write        — Phase 4 (shipped 0.5.0); needs a
                    # writable backend for mode:direct or a subagent
                    # backend for mode:agent
```

`pf_fault` and `pf_ps` are only useful when at least one
`subagent-cli` or `subagent-http` backend is configured. They can still
be enabled without one — `pf_ps` returns an empty agent list and
`pf_fault` returns `404 agent not found`.

---

## `filters`

Optional filter pipeline. Can be disabled entirely with `enabled: false`.

```yaml
filters:
  enabled: true
  path:
    allow: []                             # empty = allow all URIs for reads
    deny:
      - "memory://memory/intimate.md"
      - "self-improving://**/corrections.md"
    # Phase 4 — write-only allowlist/denylist. When at least one of
    # these is set, writes are checked exclusively against this pair
    # (not the read allow/deny above). When both are empty, writes
    # fall through to the read allow/deny pair.
    write_allow:
      - "memory://memory/20*.md"
      - "memory://memory/todos.md"
    write_deny: []
  tags:
    allow: []
    deny: ["intimate"]
  redaction:
    enabled: true
    rules:
      - pattern: '(?i)api[_-]?key\s*[:=]\s*\S+'
        replacement: "[REDACTED]"
      - pattern: 'pf_[A-Za-z0-9]+'
        replacement: "[TOKEN]"
```

| Field              | Type                     | Notes |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| `enabled`          | bool                     | Master switch — false turns everything into a pass-through. |
| `path.allow`       | string[] (glob)          | URI read allowlist. Empty = allow all. |
| `path.deny`        | string[] (glob)          | URI read denylist. Deny beats allow. |
| `path.write_allow` | string[] (glob)          | Phase 4. URI write allowlist. When set, writes are checked against this list instead of `allow`. |
| `path.write_deny`  | string[] (glob)          | Phase 4. URI write denylist. |
| `tags.allow`       | string[]                 | Resources without any matching tag are hidden. |
| `tags.deny`        | string[]                 | Resources with any matching tag are hidden. |
| `redaction.enabled`| bool                     | Compiles `rules` into a content filter. Unused rules (with `enabled: false`) are ignored. |
| `redaction.rules`  | []object                 | Each rule has `pattern` (Go regexp) and `replacement` (supports `$1`/`$2` capture groups). Invalid patterns fail fast at server start. |

**Read broadly, write narrowly.** The canonical reason to set
`path.write_allow` (or `write_deny`) instead of reusing the read
lists is so an agent can freely read any memory URI but only write to
a handful of specific files — e.g., today's daily note and the TODO
list. When either write list is non-empty, the read `allow`/`deny`
pair is **ignored** for writes.

This server-wide write filter stacks on top of the backend's own
`write_paths` allowlist — both must allow a URI for a write to
proceed. See the `filesystem` backend section above for the
per-backend write config.

### Pattern syntax

Doublestar globs (`**` for recursive match) for path patterns, plain strings
for tags, and Go `regexp` syntax for redaction rules (`(?i)` inline flag,
`\d`, `$1` capture groups, etc.).

### Order of operations

1. **URI check** (pre-fetch, reads): `path.allow` + `path.deny` — blocked URIs never
   hit the backend.
2. **Write URI check** (pre-write, pf_poke only): `path.write_allow` +
   `path.write_deny` if set, otherwise `path.allow` + `path.deny`.
   Runs before the backend's per-backend `write_paths` check.
3. **Tag check** (post-fetch): `tags.allow` + `tags.deny` — applied to
   resource metadata tags.
4. **Content transform**: `redaction.rules` — every rule is applied in
   declaration order. The transformed content is what the caller receives
   (no unredacted copy hits the wire).

---

## `audit`

```yaml
audit:
  enabled: true
  mode: "jsonl"             # "jsonl" | "stdout" | "off"
  log_path: "/var/log/pagefault/audit.jsonl"
  include_content: false    # reserved for future use
```

| Field             | Type   | Notes |
|-------------------|--------|-------|
| `enabled`         | bool   | Master switch. Implied mode is `off` when false. |
| `mode`            | enum   | `jsonl`, `stdout`, or `off`. If empty, inferred from `enabled` + `log_path`. |
| `log_path`        | path   | Required when `mode: jsonl`. Parent directory must exist. |
| `include_content` | bool   | Reserved — not honored in Phase 1. |

Each audit entry is a JSON line with fields:
`timestamp`, `caller_id`, `caller_label`, `tool`, `args` (sanitized),
`duration_ms`, `result_size`, `error`.

Sensitive fields in `args` (anything containing `token`, `password`, `secret`,
`api_key`, `authorization`) are automatically replaced with `[REDACTED]`.

---

## Environment variable substitution

`${VAR}` references in the YAML are expanded using `os.ExpandEnv` before
parsing. Example:

```yaml
auth:
  mode: "bearer"
  bearer:
    tokens_file: "${PAGEFAULT_TOKENS_FILE}"
